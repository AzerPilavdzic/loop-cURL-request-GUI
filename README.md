# Loop cURL Request GUI
A small Python GUI tool for running cURL requests in a loop with notifications and logging.

Simple cURL Runner with GUI and Auto-Loop This tool provides a lightweight Python GUI for running cURL requests on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu).

You can paste any cURL command, choose an interval in minutes, and start an automated background loop.

Each loop execution shows a desktop notification (notify-send) and logs the full API response to a file.

The loop automatically stops when the GUI window is closed.
